## 💡 Philosophy

> "Great engineering leadership isn't about being the smartest person in the room—it's about hiring people smarter than you, creating conditions where they thrive, and making strategic technical decisions that drive business outcomes. Small autonomous teams, high ownership culture, and staying close to the code while providing strategic vision: that's my approach."
